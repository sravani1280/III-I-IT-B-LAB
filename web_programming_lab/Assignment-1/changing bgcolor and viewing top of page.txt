Viewing the top of the page <br>
<p>To create a link that goes to the top of a web page
Open up your HTML file with your preferred text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. <br>
Add a HTML anchor just after the ending of the head tag. This is the start of the body code and thus is, by definition, the very top of the page.
<br>
Place the code where ever you want the link to appear. Ideally, near the end of each page or section. <br>
If you have scrolled down and come here, then click on the link below to move to the top of the page.
